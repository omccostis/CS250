# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories approach software development from the customer’s (end-user’s) perspective, making their needs central to the development process. This focus on the customer drives innovative and lucrative development of a final product that is better suited to its audience.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Previously (and unknowingly), I’ve taken an approach that is more akin to the traditional waterfall method. Each phase of development has been planned out in detail, which has made straying from the plan pretty difficult. Prioritized planning, where the most important/integral aspects of a project are more fleshed out during the planning/preparation phase, is definitely an Agile process that I will be implementing into future projects! It can help define the project in a clear way but does not lock you into a single trajectory and requires you to invest less time upfront. Time that you would need to take in a waterfall environment, which might be wasted if a change in the project’s direction makes certain aspects of the plan obsolete.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Open/prompt communication and a willingness to adapt and think on your feet are two traits that I think are integral to being a good team member in software development, especially in an Agile environment. Constant reflection and a desire to improve are also central to the Agile methodology and requires every team member to put in a conscious effort. As a developer or tester, learning about Agile principles and values and engaging with and learning from the Scrum Master is critical to a successful Agile development environment. This should not require the development team’s conscious effort if the Scrum Master is effective.
